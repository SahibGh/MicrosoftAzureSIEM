<h1>Setting up SIEM using Microsoft Azure with live cyberattacks</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves a walkthrough on creating a simple Active Directory home lab using Oracle Virtualbox. By configuring and running the lab, you gain an understanding of how the service works, as well as the networking principles behind it. In this project, a server with the necessary networking settings and features will be set up, along with a script to generate 1000 users for demonstration purposes. The result will be tested in a separate environment acting as a client or user trying to login with their new credentials.
